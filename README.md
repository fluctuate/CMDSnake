# CMDSnake
A "Snake" styled game made completely through python without pygame for Windows made in 2 hours.
(Not meant to be a well performing/looking game, but more of a proof of concept)

## Requirements:
* Windows
* Python 3.*

## How to Run/Play:
1. Run CMDSnake.py
2. Input size of game window (not pixels, but text characters. May need a try or two to get it a good size)
3. WASD are the keys to control the snake. (Up, Left, Down, Right)
4. Play. If you find an issue, please post it!

## What I Learned:
* How to accept input from console without an input()
* How to create a basic game: drawing/coordinate saving/game ticks.

## Things to Change/Fix:
* Make fruit unable to spawn in same location.
* If possible, find a way to limit the screen shake when clearing window/updating map.
* Cut down some semi-redundent code.
